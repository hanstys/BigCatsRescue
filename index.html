		<h2>Big Cat Rescue is Caring for Big Cats and Ending the Trade</h2>
		<p>Join us in the freedom fight for exotic cats!  They were designed to live free; not in cages.  The number one cause of abuse is the practice of posing with big cats and their cubs because it creates a flood of discarded cats that serve no conservation value and end up dead or in conditions that are often even worse.  You will find us to be completely transparent in our values, care of our 60+ wild cats, and finances.</p>

			<h3>Big Cat Rescue Collaborates with Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium to Bring a Jaguar and Leopard to the Sanctuary</h3>

		 <p>December 13, 2017

			For the second time in less than a week, Big Cat Rescue has new cats arriving at the sanctuary!

			We are taking in and will be the permanent home for an 11-year- old male jaguar named Manny and a 16-year- old female leopard named Nat from Omaha’s AZA-accredited Henry Doorly Zoo. What a December to Remember for the sanctuary!

			Jamie and her team of Big Cat Rescuers are driving the cats to the sanctuary in our new Dodge van that we just purr-chased thanks to the incredible generosity of donors like you who read about our desperate need for a new van in our July annual appeal letter! We are so very grateful to have this van that is not only bringing Manny and Nat to their forever home right now but will help us rescue many precious exotic cats for years to come!

			Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska is constructing expansive new natural habitats for many of their big cats and other animals. For this progress to occur, some of their current exhibits are being replaced. When Big Cat Rescue learned that the zoo was searching for a GFAS-accredited sanctuary to rehome Manny the jaguar and Nat the leopard, we immediately offered to take them.</p>

			We are happy to have collaborated with Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo to bring Manny and Nat to Big Cat Rescue, where they will remain for the rest of their lives. This type of collaboration between an AZA-accredited zoo and a GFAS-accredited sanctuary is not as common as similar facilities working within their own networks, which makes it even more special. We are delighted that the zoo has entrusted Big Cat Rescue with the ongoing well-being of these beautiful cats. We will make sure Manny and Nat continue to receive the best care possible and enjoy their retirement years at our sanctuary.

			We sincerely thank everyone who has donated to the care of our cats during our 25 years in existence and those who have donated since July to allow us to purchase our new Dodge van! If you’d like to help us out by donating toward the food and care of Manny and Nat, we would greatly appreciate it!

			Updates will be posted on on their pages at BigCatRescue.org/Manny and BigCatRescue.org/Nat</p>
